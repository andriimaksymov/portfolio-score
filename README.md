GitMerit is a full-stack developer profile intelligence platform. It analyzes GitHub activity, LinkedIn positioning, and resume/CV PDFs, then turns those inputs into scores, summaries, missing keywords, and practical improvement roadmaps.

<!-- TODO: add live demo link and 2–3 screenshots/GIF here:
     1. Landing page
     2. GitHub dashboard for a real profile
     3. CV reviewer with a highlight tooltip open -->

## What It Does

- **GitHub analysis** — deterministic scoring (activity, project quality, stack diversity, consistency) enriched with AI insights grounded in real repository evidence: flagship repos, strengths, growth areas, and a prioritized roadmap.
- **LinkedIn analysis** — upload your exported profile PDF for a section-by-section assessment: score and status per section, current state, and recommendations anchored on your target title.
- **Resume/CV analysis** — PDF extraction, professional score, issue-by-issue rewrites with exact quotes, missing keywords, and a side-by-side original vs. improved view with clickable change highlights.
- **Runs with zero API keys** — every AI-backed report has a deterministic, evidence-based fallback, so the full product works locally without signing up for anything.
- **Saved, shareable reports** — with a Postgres URL configured, every analysis persists as an immutable snapshot with a shareable `/report/:id` link and a history view.

### Key design decisions

- **Types-only shared contract** ([packages/shared](packages/shared/src/index.ts)): the analysis shapes are declared once and imported by both apps; the backend keeps zod schemas for runtime validation with a compile-time tripwire that fails the build if a schema drifts from the shared contract.
- **AI provider fallback chain** ([ai-provider.client.ts](packages/backend/src/modules/ai/providers/ai-provider.client.ts)): OpenRouter → OpenAI → Gemini → Groq, ordered by `AI_PROVIDER_ORDER`. Every call has a 45s timeout, an output-token cap, structured-output (JSON schema) mode with a schema-repair retry, and zod validation. If everything fails, a deterministic analyzer produces an evidence-based report — the product never renders a blank screen because a vendor is down.
- **No invented data**: AI output is groundedness-checked against the supplied evidence (repository names, quoted resume text); ungrounded output is replaced by the deterministic fallback. Dashboards render explicit empty states rather than filler.
- **Deterministic scoring separated from AI insights** ([scoring.service.ts](packages/backend/src/modules/scoring/scoring.service.ts)): scores are pure functions of GitHub data with a named-constant rubric — fully unit-testable and reproducible; the AI layer only explains and recommends.
- **Dual-parser PDF pipeline** ([pdf.util.ts](packages/backend/src/common/pdf.util.ts)): unpdf (modern pdf.js) with a pdf-parse fallback for real-world exports, magic-byte validation, size caps, and parse timeouts.
- **Heavy libraries load lazily**: routes are code-split, and the two PDF libraries (~2 MB combined) ship only when a resume review actually opens.

## Security & Reliability

- Helmet security headers, strict CORS from a single env-driven source, 1 MB JSON body cap.
- Global `ValidationPipe` (whitelist + forbid unknown), DTO length caps on all free-text fields that reach AI prompts, GitHub username grammar validation against path injection.
- Uploads validated by magic bytes (not the spoofable Content-Type), capped at 10 MB, parsed under a timeout.
- Per-IP throttling globally (60/min) and per expensive endpoint (10/min); LinkedIn's per-section AI fan-out is concurrency-capped.
- Provider error details are logged server-side and redacted from client responses; GitHub rate limits surface as 503 with a friendly message, not anonymous 500s.
- No secrets in the repo: keys are read from environment config only (`.env.local` is gitignored).

## Testing

| Layer                    | Tooling                                               | Command                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Backend unit (44 tests)  | Jest                                                  | `pnpm test:backend`              |
| Backend API integration  | Jest + Supertest, mocked AI/GitHub                    | `pnpm --filter backend test:e2e` |
| Frontend unit (16 tests) | Vitest + Testing Library + MSW                        | `pnpm test:frontend`             |
| Browser E2E              | Playwright (dedicated port, no dev-server collisions) | `pnpm test:e2e`                  |

The integration suite drives the real HTTP pipeline (multer limits, validation, controllers, services, deterministic AI fallback) with only the outbound boundaries stubbed. Frontend tests regression-lock the "no fabricated data" rule: an empty API response must render explicit empty states.

Run everything CI runs:

```bash
pnpm check
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer (see `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm 9 or newer
- Optional: AI provider key(s) for AI-generated report sections
- Optional: GitHub token for higher GitHub API rate limits

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andriimaksymov/gitmerit.git
cd gitmerit
pnpm install
```

### Environment

Create `.env` in the repository root (all keys optional — without them the backend uses deterministic fallbacks):

```env
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your_github_token
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
OPENROUTER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
AI_PROVIDER_ORDER=openrouter,openai,gemini,groq
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b
```

See [.env.example](.env.example) for the full annotated list.

### Report history (optional)

Analyses can be persisted with shareable `/report/:id` URLs and a `/history` view. This
needs a Postgres database (free tier: [Neon](https://neon.tech)):

```bash
# 1. Add DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... to your .env / .env.local
# 2. Create the schema:
pnpm --filter backend db:push
```

Without `DATABASE_URL` everything else works normally — history simply stays disabled.

### Run Locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:3001/api`

### Deployment

The frontend deploys to Vercel as a static Vite app (root directory `packages/frontend`,
set `VITE_API_URL` to the backend's `/api` URL — it is baked in at build time).

The backend deploys two ways:

- **Vercel serverless** — `packages/backend/api/index.ts` adapts the Nest app to a
  single function (see its docblock). Note Vercel's schema rejects unknown keys in
  `vercel.json`, and Hobby caps function duration at 60s, which long AI analyses can hit.
- **A long-running Node host** (Render/Railway/Fly) — no duration cap, better fit for
  SSE streaming. Because the backend depends on the `@gitmerit/shared` workspace package,
  the build **must run from the repo root with pnpm** — a checkout scoped to
  `packages/backend` cannot resolve `workspace:*`. The included [render.yaml](render.yaml)
  encodes the working configuration:

```bash
# build (repo root; --prod=false keeps the nest/prisma CLIs available)
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod=false && pnpm --filter backend build
# start
node packages/backend/dist/main
```

Set `FRONTEND_URL` on the backend so CORS admits the deployed frontend origin.
